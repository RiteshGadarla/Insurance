# InsureGrid.ai

**AI Powered Health Insurance Claim Validation Platform**

## 🚀 Overview

InsureGrid.ai is an AI powered verification engine designed to reduce health insurance claim rejections caused by documentation gaps and technical errors.

Insurance claims are frequently rejected due to missing files, incorrect ICD or CPT codes, mismatched patient details, and non compliant documentation formats. These rejections result in financial losses, delayed reimbursements, operational inefficiencies, and reduced patient trust.

InsureGrid shifts hospitals from a reactive rework model to a proactive validation model by detecting errors before claims are submitted to insurers.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Health insurance claim rejections are primarily caused by:

* Technical documentation errors
* Missing signatures or incorrect ICD-10 / CPT codes
